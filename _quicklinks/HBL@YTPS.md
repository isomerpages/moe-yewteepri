### HBL@YTPS

The school will ensure continuity in learning during Home-Based Learning (HBL).

Based on individual classes’ learning profile, the nature of HBL may include the following approaches:

*   Online learning (e.g. using the Student Learning Space (SLS) or other online assignments);
*   Offline work (e.g. using students’ textbooks, workbooks or worksheets); or
*   Live synchronous lessons/ check-ins via video conferencing.

Students will receive the day’s HBL learning guide via the school’s HBL microsite. By referring to the HBL learning guide, students will be informed of the day’s HBL activities.
