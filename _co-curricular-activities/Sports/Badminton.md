### Badminton

YTPS Badminton CCA develops students' sporting excellence through this dynamic racquet sport. Students master essential techniques including serving, smashing, and defensive play, while systematic footwork training enhances their court coverage and agility. Regular training sessions build physical fitness, stamina, and strength through structured drills and practice matches. <br><br>

Beyond technical skills, the CCA nurtures important school values as students develop resilience through challenging training, demonstrate sportsmanship in competitions, and build teamwork during doubles play. Through dedicated coaching, students progress from beginners to competent players while maintaining an active lifestyle and forming lasting friendships within our badminton community.<br><br>
