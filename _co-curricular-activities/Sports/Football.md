### Football

At Yew Tee Primary School, our Football CCA welcomes boys from Primary 3 to 6, providing a nurturing environment that supports growth both on and off the pitch. Our programme goes beyond technical skills to instil important values like perseverance, respect, and responsibility through sport. We emphasise inclusivity, ensuring every student develops at their own pace in a safe and encouraging environment. 

Through age-appropriate drills, team exercises, and friendly matches, students build both confidence and competence. Leadership opportunities as team captains and peer mentors help develop communication and decision-making skills that extend beyond football
