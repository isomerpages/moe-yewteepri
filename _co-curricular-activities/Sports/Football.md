### Football

#### CCA Overview

YTPS Football CCA seeks to provide the boys with exposure, experience and the opportunity for excellence. Our boys learn, play and develop their skills progressively through fun exercises, agility training and friendly matches. Apart from tactical game play, our Football coaches also focus on character-building and values such as desire, discipline and determination. Our boys are also taught life skills through discussion as well as reflection. We aspire to empower our boys to become effective communicators who can set goals and problem-solve during game play as well as their day to day life.
