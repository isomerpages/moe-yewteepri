### Wushu

At YTPS, our Wushu CCA delves deep into this ancient Chinese martial art. The name "Wǔshù" (武术) itself reflects its essence—武 (wǔ) representing martial aspects, while 术 (shù) embodies skill and artistry.

Our programme extends beyond physical techniques to develop both martial prowess and inner strength. Through regular training, students cultivate essential values like discipline, respect, perseverance and resilience. They learn these through mastering precise movements, observing traditional martial arts etiquette, and pushing past their perceived limitations.

Through this holistic approach, our Wushu CCA shapes not just skilled martial artists, but young individuals of strong character ready to face life's challenges.
