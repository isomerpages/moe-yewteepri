### Wushu

#### CCA Overview

Through YTPS Wushu CCA, we aimed to develop nurture our students in terms of skills and character. Wushu is an important component of the cultural heritage of China. Wǔshù literally means martial art. It is formed from the two words 武术: 武 (wǔ), meaning martial or military; and 术 (shù), which translates into discipline, skill or method.Thus, other than martial art techniques, discipline is constantly being emphasised in all sessions.
