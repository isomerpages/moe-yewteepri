### Floorball

#### CCA Overview

YTPS Floorball CCA aims to strengthen the studentsâ€™ character as a whole and to bring out best in every member of the team. We hope to develop the students physically and also inculcate values such as resilience and respect in them. Floorball is a game of strategy and through the process, it helps our students to build mental endurance as well as mutual trust and friendship among themselves.

Our team trains dedicatedly in every session and the school provides opportunities for the students to gain experience and encourage them to enjoy participating in the sport.
