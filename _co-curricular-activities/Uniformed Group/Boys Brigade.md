### Boys Brigade

The Boys Brigade 78 Junior Singapore Company (BB78J) develops boys into responsible and respectful individuals through physical, educational, social, and exemplary growth programmes. 

Our Boys participate in two national competitions: The Adventure Quest (AQ) for creative problem-solving, and the Character Quest (CQ) for applying moral values through practical activities. 

Weekly parades and annual camps engage our Boys in games, outdoor cooking, and leadership training, fostering essential life skills and strong friendships. Through community service projects like BB Cares and BB Share-A-Gift, they learn to understand and serve the less fortunate in society. The various activities and camps throughout the year provide platforms for interaction and personal development, contributing to their growth as well-rounded individuals.
