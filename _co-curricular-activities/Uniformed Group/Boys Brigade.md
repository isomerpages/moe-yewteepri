### Boys Brigade

#### CCA Overview

78J engages our boys in meaningful and purposeful activities in moulding them to be responsible and respectful individuals. The Adventure Quest (AQ) and Character Quest (CQ) challenge our Boys to problem-solve in creative ways and learn about moral values to apply them in activities. The weekly parades and annual camp focus on character-building and developing a strong moral sense through games and story-telling and discussion sessions.
