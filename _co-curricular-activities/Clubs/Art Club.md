### Art Club

#### CCA Overview



Art club is a great way to keep students involved throughout the year. With limited time in the classroom, art club serves as a nice supplement for those students who canâ€™t get enough of making art! As Art club members, students learn various forms of art-making to express different themes and take part in national art events such as Singapore Youth Festival.

  

Art club members are also given opportunities to work in groups to try a variety of mediums e.g. stop motion, sand art and mosaic art that challenge and stretch their potential. They also get to go on a field trips to visit art museums and learn about different artists.

  

Art club members develop a growth mindset and learn that creative process is an adventure where they create, experiment and learn to work as a team to discuss, design and create an art piece.
