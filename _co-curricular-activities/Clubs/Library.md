### Library

#### CCA Overview

Our student librarians play an important role in building the love for reading among their peers. They assume the role as ambassadors to demonstrate the right etiquette in utilising the library and its resources. This helps other students enjoy their trips to the library.

Student librarians also plan and coordinate ‘Take Me Home’, a programme that gives old books from the library a new lease of life. They are actively involved in the selection and organisation of old books for the appropriate levels.

To cultivate the awareness of current affairs and encourage critical thinking among our student librarians, contemporary issues are discussed in depth. This gives them the opportunity to share their perspectives confidently.
