<h2><strong>Strategy Club</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>In Strategy Club, students master both classic and modern board games
- from the timeless strategies of Chess and Weiqi to the delightful challenges
of Sushi Go Party and Machi Koro 2. Through engaging gameplay, students
develop critical thinking, strategic planning, and decision-making skills
in an environment that makes learning feel like play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether cracking codes in Mastermind, planning the perfect city, or orchestrating
a winning chess gambit, every session offers new challenges that stretch
young minds. Best of all, these skills develop naturally as students compete,
collaborate, and build lasting friendships with fellow strategists.</p>
