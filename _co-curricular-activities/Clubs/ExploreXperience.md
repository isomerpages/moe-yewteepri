<p>The ExploreXperience Club is a distinctive modular CCA requiring commitment
from Primary 3 to 6, where students explore over ten different activities
throughout their journey. Each term introduces new experiences across sports,
aesthetics, technology, strategic games, soft skills, and Values-in-Action
projects, all conducted by teachers and certified trainers.</p>

<p>While the programme doesn't support sports or arts DSA, students can still
pursue DSA through other pathways such as Leadership, Academic aptitude
(STEM, Mathematics, Science), or Bilingualism. This unique approach focuses
on building a broad foundation for lifelong learning through diverse experiences
rather than specialization in a single area.</p>
