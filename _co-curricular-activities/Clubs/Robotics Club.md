### Robotics Club

#### CCA Overview

Our Robotics Club has participated in two major Robotics Competition which are National Robotics Programming Competition (NRPC) in June and National Robotics Competition (NRC) in September 2019. Through these competitions, our team clinched the championship award in NRPC and the 1st runner up in NRC. Taking part in these competitions has taught them resilience and working well with their team members.
