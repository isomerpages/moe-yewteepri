<h3>Environment Club</h3>
<p>The Environment Club at YTPS nurtures passionate environmental stewards
through immersive learning experiences. Members engage in practical activities,
environmental projects, and educational visits, whilst also participating
in nationwide sustainability competitions. These experiences help them
develop a deeper appreciation of environmental challenges and empower them
to take meaningful action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club's activities align with the school's CCLAS framework, particularly
emphasising the values of Care and Responsibility. Students demonstrate
care by actively contributing to environmental causes, whilst taking responsibility
by developing and implementing ecological solutions. Through involvement
in both school and community environmental initiatives, members develop
essential skills in leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving. The
club also provides a platform for students to connect with peers who share
their environmental passion, enabling them to work together to create lasting
positive change.</p>
