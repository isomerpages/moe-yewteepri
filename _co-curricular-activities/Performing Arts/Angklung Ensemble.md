### Angklung Ensemble

#### CCA Overview

Students learn how to play variations of ensemble pieces and embark on enriching learning journeys to learn more about the angklung and the world of music. The ensemble also participates in musical experiences and activities held in collaboration with other organisations to hone their musical skills in playing the angklung. They clinched a Distinction Award at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2018.

The team also performed at external platforms such as Mother Tongue Languages Symposium in 2017 and North West Youth Concert in 2019.
