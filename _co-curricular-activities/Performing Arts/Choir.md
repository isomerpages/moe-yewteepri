### Choir

#### CCA Overview

Music is the universal language of mankind and the passion for music is the force that draws our students to come together.

In order to build up the members’ stage experience and confidence, our choir team has participated in a number of events such as ‘The Showcase’, Performing Arts Show and Singapore Rhapsodies at the National Gallery.

In 2018, our Choir attained the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (SYF AP). Our Choir has also performed in external events such as the American Polygraph Association (Asia Pacific) Conference at Fullerton Hotel in 2018. In 2019, our school performed with Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School Choir for the SYF Celebrations Festival Concert at the Esplanade Theatre. Last year, a team of choir students also performed for an online SYF Re-imagined event.
