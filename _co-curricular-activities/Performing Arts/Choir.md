### Choir

Music brings people together, and our school Choir provides a platform for students to express themselves through the joy of singing, while fostering teamwork and a love for music. 

In 2024, the Choir reached a significant milestone by attaining the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation—a testament to the students’ dedication and musical growth.

The Choir continues to contribute actively to the school community. Members performed at the school's 25th Anniversary Concert and showcased their festive spirit during the Lunar New Year celebration, adding joy and cultural vibrancy to the event.

To enrich their learning, students also participate in exchange sessions with other school choirs, gaining exposure and building friendships through music.
