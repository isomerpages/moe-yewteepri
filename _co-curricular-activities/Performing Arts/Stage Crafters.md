<p>Students also dive into the behind-the-curtain wonders of theatre. They
learn to craft props from recyclable items and become costume designers,
set builders, and&nbsp; ‘tech-crew’ for live shows. Our productions often
explore meaningful social issues like kindness, inclusion and environmental
care — giving students a voice to inspire change while having fun.</p>
