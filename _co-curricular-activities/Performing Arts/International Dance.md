### Modern Dance

#### CCA Overview

Dance is a language of expression and dancers learn valuable lessons such as perseverance and care by encouraging one another and working together to perfect their dance steps. They also learn to develop integrity, respect and responsibility through the rigorous dance practices to ensure that there are no gaps in their dance formation. Their dedication has resulted in a Distinction Award in 2018.

International Dance also performed at the American Polygraph Association (Asia Pacific) Conference at the Fullerton Hotel in 2018 and at Yew Tee CCC National Day Dinner in 2019.



Our Modern Dance CCA was invited to perform at the National Day Observance Ceremony organized by the Prime Minister's Office at the Treasury Building on 8 August. The 12 Primary 5 and 6 students danced their way into the hearts of the audience. We are so proud of the girls.
