### Art Club

#### CCA Overview


The Art Club extends students' artistic development beyond the regular classroom, providing opportunities for those passionate about visual arts to deepen their skills and creativity. Members explore various artistic techniques and practices, learning to express different ideas through art forms while participating in national events like the Singapore Youth Festival.

The club emphasises collaborative experiences, with students working together on diverse mediums including stop motion animation, digital art, and mosaic design. Students exercise agency by making their own decisions about materials and techniques, fostering ownership of their creative process. They also benefit from learning journeys to museums and galleries, gaining exposure to established artists' works and art history, while having opportunities to showcase their artwork in public exhibitions and joint showcases with other schools.

Through these experiences, students develop a growth mindset and learn that creativity involves exploration, experimentation, and teamwork. The club environment encourages open discussion of ideas, thoughtful design, and confident contribution to shared artworks, helping members grow as young artists.
