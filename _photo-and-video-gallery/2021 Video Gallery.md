What makes Yew Tee Primary School special in these unique pandemic times, is how normal everything seems; the appearance of mundanity in the face of crisis. This is all thanks to the dedication of the various staff behind the scenes. As such, we owe a debt of gratitude to our unsung heroes, keeping our classrooms disinfected, our premises safe and our equipment working, in order for us to provide the best possible education for our students in these troubled times.
