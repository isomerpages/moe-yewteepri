<h1>SPARKLE</h1>
<h4><strong>High Ability Learners (HAL) Programme</strong></h4>
<p>As we prepare students for a fast-paced and rapidly evolving future, Yew
Tee Primary School recognises that each child develops at different pace
and possesses unique strengths and interests that we are committed to develop.
Our HAL Programme adopts a progressive approach to support students who
can benefit from a more challenging curriculum with exposure to a wider
variety of educational opportunities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With a belief that every child is uniquely different, our vision is to
develop and stretch students in their areas of strength and interest, beyond
the academic domains. Besides further stretching them in particular subjects,
our HAL Programme offers differentiated learning experiences for selected
Primary 4 and Primary 5 students, focusing on sharpening critical thinking
skills, sparking innovation and developing the joy of learning through
authentic contexts. Whatever the start points, we will help every student
to learn, develop and grow, and realise their full potential.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 4</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme in Primary 4 encompasses three enriching streams designed
to develop different aspects of our studentsâ€™ potential.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Through our <em>Robotics and Coding Programme</em>, students explore the
world of programming using Smorphi Robots. This programme seeks to develop
creative, critical and computational thinking in students, offering them
the opportunity to apply their learning and showcasing their skills at
the national platforms such as National Robotics Competition (NRC) Smorphi
Challenge and SUTD Roboroarz Competitions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>E2K (Excellence 2000) Mathematics and Science programmes</em> challenge
students to think deeply and develop advanced problem-solving capabilities
through hands-on and inquiry-based learning activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>Reading Circles</em>, students develop both literacy and communication
skills through meaningful discussions and presentations. They learn to
express their ideas confidently, engage in thoughtful dialoguing with peers
and develop empathy by understanding different perspectives through text
exploration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Primary 5</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At the Primary 5 level, students engage in two distinctive programmes
that foster innovation and analytical thinking skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The<em> Innovation Programme (IvP)</em> guides students through the complete
process of creative problem-solving, from identifying real-world challenges
to developing practical solutions under the guidance of experienced innovation
mentors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>E2K Mathematics programme </em>continues to stretch students' mathematical
thinking through challenging concepts and constructivist learning approaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
