### Learning for Life Programme - HEROES@YTPS

#### Programme Overview

The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), known as **HEROES**@YTPS (**H**olistic, **E**nriching, and **R**ewarding experiences in **O**utdoor **E**ducation and **S**ports), creates an environment where students can build a strong foundation for continual growth, leading to enhanced physical, social and emotional wellbeing. The programme integrates school values, social-emotional competencies, civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skillsâ€”essential elements for 21st-century learning. Students demonstrate these acquired skills through major annual sporting events, cohort outdoor learning journeys and Co-curricular Activities. 

Through immersive participation in physical activities and nurturing a lasting enthusiasm for sports and outdoor pursuits, students embrace the HEROES@YTPS ethos. The programme provides comprehensive opportunities for developing fundamental motor skills, exploring diverse sports, engaging in recreational activities and excelling in competitive events. 

Outdoor education centres on cultivating ruggedness and resilience. Students embark on a progressive journey exploring Singapore's varied landscapes, beginning with structured learning in familiar neighbourhoods and advancing to more challenging environments. Our carefully crafted age-appropriate outdoor challenges develop crucial skills in navigation, safety awareness and teamwork, while fostering environmental appreciation and adventure-based cooperative learning.

##### Outdoor Learning Progression: 
* Primary 1-2: Neighbourhood exploration and basic orientation 
* Primary 3-4: Park connector networks and urban green spaces 
* Primary 5-6: Advanced outdoor experiences and challenging terrains 
* Integration of map reading, route planning, and decision-making skills 

This holistic approach empowers students to make informed choices based on their interests and abilities, while developing the knowledge, skills and mindset needed for an active lifestyle. These experiences become powerful platforms for character development, nurturing team spirit and responsibility, while fostering social integration and racial harmony.
