### Character and Citizenship Education

#### Department Overview

The school takes an integrated approach to Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE), where values underpin both the Curriculum and the Co-curriculum to nurture every child into&nbsp;_Reflective Learners, Gracious Citizens_. This stems from our belief that every child has intrinsic worth, can and wants to learn, and should contribute as gracious and responsible citizens of the world. As such, our teachers care deeply and infuse CCE or teach it explicitly in the classroom, create experiences to internalise values and strengthen rootedness through school/level/CCA activities, and provide opportunities for students to demonstrate and develop positive behaviour.

Synthesising all these into a coherent experience for the children is the school’s signature&nbsp;_Citizenship, Creativity, Leadership, Action and Service_&nbsp;(CCLAS) platform – an enabler in our Total Curriculum Framework (TCF) that was adapted from the International Baccalaureate Programme as well as the National Youth Achievement Award. Every child joining our school thus embarks on a journey of self-discovery to maximise their potential, through experiential learning in these five domains that challenge them to grow personally and interpersonally, with civic and social mindedness regardless of their starting point.

#### Key Programmes

##### Citizenship

Rootedness and a sense of belonging are key to Citizenship experiences within the school and its importance is highlighted by its place as the first domain of CCLAS and articulated as&nbsp;_Gracious Citizens_&nbsp;in the school vision. In addition, students learn about the&nbsp;_Singapore Spirit_&nbsp;through the Yew Tee Primary Heritage Trail, which traces the humble beginnings of the community and nation to its modern transformation. By leveraging on the&nbsp;_Joy of Learning_&nbsp;through the various NE commemorative events and learning journeys as well as school based learning packages, students make the connection that they too can have a promising future if they adopt and develop the Singapore Spirit.

##### Contemporary Issues Discussion
The English department collaborates with the CCE Department to conduct CCE based discussion during English Language lessons on a monthly basis. Such platforms allow students to engage in values-based discussion on contemporary issues and apply responsible decision-making and perspective taking skills in real life scenarios.

##### Yew Tee Village Community Centre
The Mother Tongue department collaborates with the CCE Department with the common aim to raise multi-cultural awareness amongst YTPS students. The Yew Tee Village Community Centre (YTVCC) space, which is integrated as part of the school’s heritage trail, serves as a cultural learning hub for our students to learn about the different cultures, festivals celebrated by the different races as well as to commemorate National Education commemorative events in the school.

##### Creativity
In the school, ‘Making Character Visible’ is a continuous aspiration made possible with the opportunities through Art as a subject. Students are able to use Art as a powerful form of expression of their thoughts, values and aspirations. This strongly supports the delivery of CCE outcomes in the school and makes reinforcement of values and making character visible a fun and colourful process.

##### Leadership

The school believes that every student can become a leader and takes an evidence-based, values-driven approach to leadership development that is adapted from&nbsp;_The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership_&nbsp;by Kouzes and Posner. Referred to as The YTPS Student Leadership model, it guides the provision of training, opportunities, knowledge and skills development of students so that they can lead themselves, try to lead others and aspire to lead the school.

##### Service

Values-in-Action within the school is progressive in nature, and starts with student awareness of service opportunities at home, then school and followed by community needs. It is also focused on two core domains, best encapsulated using the school value of Care as an acronym –&nbsp;**C**aring for The&nbsp;**A**ged &amp;&nbsp;**R**especting the&nbsp;**E**nvironment, to address the future challenges of sustainable development and an aging population. This approach is also grounded in authentic learning experiences by its integration with project work as part of the Applied Learning Programme; with its outcomes serving as platforms for the learning and demonstration of values.
