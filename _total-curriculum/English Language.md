### English Language

#### Department Overview

The school believes that a strong proficiency in the English Language helps students to process and keep up with information in a world where English has become the main language of communication, connect with the wider community and eventually access the opportunities of a knowledge-based economy. This is why the development of effective language use amongst students that is determined by their purpose, audience, context and culture guides the department in building a strong foundation and providing rich language for all.

Students’ development in the areas of language learning such as listening, reading, speaking, writing, grammar and vocabulary is shaped by tasks/activities designed to facilitate learning of the language in authentic and meaningful contexts. Moreover, teachers will provide a rich environment for communication that fosters listening/speaking skills with a focus on achieving the learning outcomes. This means that language learning will be taught in an integrated way, with the use of relevant resources that support multiple perspectives and meaningful connections.

Teachers also model and scaffold the development of knowledge and skills, taking care to put students at the centre of teaching-learning and differentiating instruction according to the students’ needs, abilities and interests. As such, students will be given time to learn, with skills, grammatical items, structures and various types of texts being taught, revised and revisited at increasing levels of difficulty and sophistication over six years.
