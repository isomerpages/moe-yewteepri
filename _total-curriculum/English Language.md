### English Language

#### Department Overview

Guided by our school vision of nurturing Reflective Learners, Gracious Citizens, the school is committed to developing effective and purposeful English Language users. 

We believe that a strong foundation in the English Language is essential for students to make sense of rapid advancements, connect meaningfully with the wider community and eventually access opportunities in an innovative and empathy-driven world. 

This belief drives the department’s commitment to developing language users who are not only aware of purpose, audience, context and culture but also able to apply this awareness in their interactions. Our programmes are designed to nurture listening, reading, speaking, writing, grammar and vocabulary skills through learning tasks that are meaningful and set in authentic contexts. 

Teachers create a language-rich environment that fosters communication and critical thinking through thought-provoking and engaging activities. Language learning is approached in an integrated manner, using resources that reflect diverse perspectives and encourage real-world connections. 

At the heart of our teaching and learning processes is a student-centred approach. Teachers model and scaffold language skills while differentiating instruction to meet varied learning needs, interests and talents. Students are given time to build their confidence and raise their competencies, as language concepts are introduced, revisited and deepened across the six years.

#### Key Programmes

##### Super Readers, Assemble! 
This week-long event has our school buzzing with various activities and initiatives designed to engage and inspire our students. Through the exploration of the wonderful world of books, our students enhance their literacy skills and cultivate a lifelong love for reading. 
<br>The highlight of the event is ‘Characters Come Alive!’ Day, when students come dressed as storybook characters. Stepping into the shoes of their favourite storybook characters and embodying their traits, our students embark on a memorable role-play adventure!

##### Spelling Bee 
To support our students in enhancing their spelling skills, students from Primary 1 to 3 take part in **Spelling Bee competitions**. These friendly competitions give students the opportunity to apply their word recognition and decoding skills as they compete with their peers. Held twice a year, the Spelling Bee has become a much-anticipated and well-loved event—enjoyed by both participants and members of the audience alike!

##### Oracy Programmes 
We believe that being confident and articulate users in the English Language is key to helping our students express themselves clearly and connect meaningfully with others. Through oracy enrichment programmes in Speech and Drama, Poetry Recitation, and Storytelling and Dramatisation, students have opportunities to develop strong communication skills in ways that are both enjoyable and purposeful. These are rich learning experiences designed to build their confidence, creativity and presentation skills.

##### Literature Infusion 
Imaginative thinkers, confident speakers and joyful readers! Through this programme, our students learn to appreciate literature and creative expression. In Primary 2, students explore classic fairy tales, learning about their features and familiar elements like magic, good versus evil and happy endings. With a focus on fractured fairy tales, Primary 3 students are encouraged to creatively reimagine these classic tales and experiment with rhymes to develop a sense of rhythm and expression. 

Finally, Primary 4 students delve into poetry — reading, writing and analysing poems as they explore poetic forms and their features in engaging activities.
