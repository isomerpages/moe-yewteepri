### Physical Education and Aesthetics

#### Department Overview
Yew Tee Primary School believes that the participation and pursuit of physical activities and sports enriches students’ lives, particularly at primary level where children are still developing physically. The proper development of physical skills, practices and values will allow them to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

Similarly, developing a sensitivity for Aesthetics gives students an awareness of beauty and taste that creates memories, communicates ideas and evokes emotions so that they can better understand, engage with and navigate the world they live in. Creating art or music also engenders creativity and self-worth as students learn to reflect on and express their individuality and uniqueness.

This is why the department is committed to providing a strong foundation for every student in Physical Education, Art and Music. Physical Education and Co-curricular Activities nurture the Action component while Art and Music drives the Creativity aspect of the school’s CCLAS approach to character development.

#### Key Programmes

##### Physical Education
At Yew Tee Primary School (YTPS), we firmly believe that physical education forms a cornerstone of holistic student development. Our comprehensive approach to physical activities and sports is particularly crucial during the primary years – a pivotal period when children undergo significant physical development and motor skill acquisition.

##### Educational Philosophy 
Our programme is built upon the understanding that early exposure to diverse physical activities lays the foundation for lifelong wellness. Through structured physical education, students develop fundamental movement skills, sports competencies, and most importantly, a genuine appreciation for an active lifestyle.

##### Guiding Framework 
The Physical Education and Sports Development Framework serves as our pedagogical compass, ensuring systematic and effective delivery of physical education. This research-based framework aligns with national educational objectives while catering to our students' developmental needs.

The figure below shows a diagrammatic representation of the framework.

##### Strategic Implementation 
Our PE curriculum encompasses: 
* Progressive skill development across different sports disciplines 
* Age-appropriate physical challenges and activities 
* Opportunities for both recreational and competitive sports 
* Integration of character development through sports 
* Regular assessment of physical competencies and progress

##### Vision and Desired Outcomes 
We aspire to nurture students who: 
* Demonstrate physical literacy and competence in various movement skills 
* Understand and appreciate the value of regular physical activity 
* Develop resilience and sportspersonship through physical challenges 
* Make informed choices about their personal fitness and well-being 
* Potentially excel in sports at competitive levels, including national representation

Through this comprehensive approach, YTPS strives to empower every student with the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle well beyond their primary school years. <br><br>

##### Art Education

The aims of art education are to enable every child to:
*   enjoy art
*   communicate visually
*   make meaning through connecting with society and culture

##### Domain and key competencies:



|See|Express|Appreciate|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|Competencies:<br> Observe – Wonder – Inquire|Competencies:<br> Create – Innovate – Present|Competencies:<br> Reflect – Connect – Respond|
|In seeing art, our students observe their surrounding closely, and analyse and reflect on their visual and other experiences. The focus will be on recording and interpreting as means towards developing students’ observation and visual inquiry. Students will be equipped with tools such as drawing to capture and reflect on their observations and lived experiences.|In expressing art, our students generate ideas from what they see and explore ways to create and communicate through the use of various conventional and unconventional materials and tools, art forms and media. Students also experiment and innovate with visual elements, qualities of materials, tools and six artistic processes in order to meet an artistic intention. To promote metacognition and deepen the dispositions as artist and audience, students get to present choices and voices within their art processes, progress and products through portfolio process and display platforms in tandem with their developmental capacities and interest.|In appreciating art, our students acquire skills and use appropriate vocabulary to discuss and interpret artworks. Students deepen their understanding of Singapore through drawing inspirations from their environment, learning about artworks and artists from local and other cultures and context to make connections and understand the values of art in their lives and society.|

##### Co-curriculum – Programme for Active Learning

The school offers Programme for Active Learning (PAL) that focuses on learning beyond the classroom. This is in line with MOE’s approach in learning to prepare students for the 21st Century and to bring about Joy of Learning, Entrepreneurial Dare and Singapore Spirit. 

PAL provides students the opportunity to experience the joy of learning through the acquisition of new skills and the discovery of new interests. They will also display traits of Entrepreneurial Dare and a Growth Mindset of ‘I Can learn’ by thinking of innovative ways of doing tasks. The students persevere to solve problems posed to them during the PAL activities. PAL is customised to encourage students to embrace the Singapore Spirit. This is achieved through character development embedded in the activities where students learn how to work as a team and accepting each other’s differences. They also give peer support to their friends during group activities where they learn how to ask for help politely but also give a helping hand to a friend in need. This set their journey into becoming Reflective Learners and Gracious Citizens. 

The table below shows the exciting activities in PAL sports, outdoor education, performing and visual arts that the Primary 1 and Primary 2 students are experiencing in the various PAL modules:



||Module 1|Module 2|Module 3|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|**Primary 1**|PAL Dance|PAL Drama|PAL Sports and Games|
|**Primary 2**|PAL Art|PAL Music|PAL Outdoor Education|

##### Characteristics of PAL Modules 
All the modules engage students through their heads, hearts and hands. They are designed with the following five characteristics in mind: 
1. Experiential in nature They provide students with meaningful engagement through experiential learning in a safe environment. Reflection time is included to give students opportunities to express their thoughts and feelings, and build confidence in communication. <br>
2. Encompasses learning in a creative way They provide students the space to explore ideas to a new situation, to deepen their learning, make new connections to the previous skills and knowledge, and make new self-discovery. <br>
3. Provides opportunities for children to create They provide opportunity for creative expression which helps students learn at a deeper level, provides enjoyment and leads to problem-solving. <br>
4. Incorporates values education and social-emotional learning Through individual and group activities, students are able to learn about themselves and understand how to better relate to and work with others in a team, which is an important competency to acquire to thrive in a globalised world. <br>
5. Fun and enjoyable By focusing on the process of learning, the thinking and doing during the experience, and not just on the end product and skills acquisition, PAL allows students to expand into new areas that are both enjoyable and challenging so that they will be able to make connections and appreciate the finer things in life.<br>
