### Science

#### Department Overview
The school believes that a strong foundation in Science helps to develop students into confident learners, critical thinkers and active inquirers. The Science curriculum seeks to nurture the student as an inquirer. The starting point is that children are curious about and want to explore the things around them. The Science curriculum leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity. The end goal is students who enjoy Science and value Science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.

Adopting the 5-E instructional model, and leveraging on technology, students are provided with structured science experiences to develop their sense of inquiry.

Moreover, through the Environmental Learning programme, STEM Learning programme and various Science-related activities/competitions, students are provided with opportunities to develop their innovative thinking and problem solving skills.
