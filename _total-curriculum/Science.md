### Science

#### Department Overview
In YTPS, we believe that a strong foundation in Science plays a pivotal role in developing our students into confident learners, critical thinkers and active inquirers. At the heart of the Singapore Science curriculum is the role of a student as an inquirer. An inquiring mind is always backed by the curious and exploratory nature of children. The Science learning experiences in YTPS leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity. By asking questions about their surroundings and the world, students learn to value the relevance and meaningful nature of Science and be inspired by its ability to transform the world the improve lives. Adopting the 5-E instructional model, and leveraging on technology, students are provided with structured learning experiences to develop their sense of inquiry. The key programmes of the department such as the Environmental Learning Programme (ELP) and STEM Learning Programme (STEM) are geared to provide students with opportunities to develop problem-solving skills and innovate using Science.

#### Key Programmes

##### Environmental Learning Programme (ELP)
The learning of Science should not be limited to the confines of a classroom or a laboratory. ELP leverages on our environment as the third teacher. By creating opportunities for our students to visit designated spaces in the outdoors, ELP evokes the spirit of inquiry and stimulates curiosity in our learners. The outdoor lessons allow our students to relate their content knowledge to what they can observe and enthuse them further to become self-directed learners who actively seek Science in nature.

ELP also serves to educate students on food sustainability and ways to overcome this despite our land scarcity. Our students tried their hand at hydroponics farming. They also harvested their crops and shared it with the staff in school. This experience not only teaches our students how to grow their own food but also inspires our students by reinforcing the relevance and meaningful nature of Science to improve lives and transform the world positively.

##### STEM Learning Programme (STEM)
The multi-disciplinary STEM Learning Programme in YTPS sparks the interest of students by providing them with opportunities to enact authentic scenarios. In the process of problem-solving, our students think critically and become reflective learners. They also communicate openly and respectfully while apply their knowledge in Science and other areas such as Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.

##### Sony Creative Science Award (SCSA)

The Sony Creative Science Award (SCSA) is Singapore’s largest toy-making competition. Students who are interesting in making a toy based on Scientific principles, go through a series of workshops by our very own teachers. During the workshop, our students learn more about design-thinking and proto-typing. They consult with a team of teachers to get advice on their designs and improve on their initial design before tapping on their creativity and making their very own toy.

#### Achievements
##### Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC)
SAFMC provides a unique platform for students to push the boundaries of innovation by designing and creating extraordinary flying machines by applying their knowledge gained on aerodynamics and demonstrating their passion for flight science.

YTPS teachers and students met this challenge headfirst for the very first time. Four teams of Primary 5 students rose to the challenge and give it their best. Of the four teams, two of our teams tasted success and brought home the following wins:

1.	Overall Champion for Primary School Category
2.	2nd Position in Boomerang Award
3.	2nd Position in Time Aloft Award
4.	3rd Position in Boomerang Award
