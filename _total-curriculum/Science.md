### Science

#### Department Overview
In YTPS, we believe that a strong foundation in Science plays a pivotal role in developing our students into confident learners, critical thinkers and active inquirers. At the heart of the Singapore Science curriculum is the role of a student as an inquirer. An inquiring mind is always backed by the curious and exploratory nature of children. The Science learning experiences in YTPS leverages on and seeks to fuel this spirit of curiosity. By asking questions about their surroundings and the world, students learn to value the relevance and meaningful nature of Science and be inspired by its ability to transform the world the improve lives. Adopting the 5-E instructional model, and leveraging on technology, students are provided with structured learning experiences to develop their sense of inquiry. The key programmes of the department such as the Environmental Learning Programme (ELP) and STEM Learning Programme (STEM) are geared to provide students with opportunities to develop problem-solving skills and innovate using Science.

#### Key Programmes

##### Environmental Learning Programme (ELP)
The learning of Science should not be limited to the confines of a classroom or a laboratory. ELP leverages on our environment as the third teacher. By creating opportunities for our students to visit designated spaces in the outdoors, ELP evokes the spirit of inquiry and stimulates curiosity in our learners. The outdoor lessons allow our students to relate their content knowledge to what they can observe and enthuse them further to become self-directed learners who actively seek Science in nature.

ELP also serves to educate students on food sustainability and ways to overcome this despite our land scarcity. Our students tried their hand at hydroponics farming. They also harvested their crops and shared it with the staff in school. This experience not only teaches our students how to grow their own food but also inspires our students by reinforcing the relevance and meaningful nature of Science to improve lives and transform the world positively.


Learning of Science is not limited to only inside the classrooms or Science labs. ELP evokes the spirit of inquiry and stimulates curiosity. Students are brought around these designated spaces for their Science lessons to enthuse them and encourage them to become self-directed learners.
