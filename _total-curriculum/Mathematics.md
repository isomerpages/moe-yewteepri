### Mathematics

#### Department Overview
The school believes that a solid grounding in Mathematics trains the mind and fosters essential emerging 21st-century skills like logical, critical, abstract, adaptive and creative thinking. These competencies are crucial for everyday life, support learning across various disciplines, and provide an edge in economic activities, innovation, and entrepreneurship. 

Our department’s overarching aim is to ensure every student achieves a competent level of mathematical mastery, while supporting those with the interest and ability to pursue higher levels. Teaching is designed to help students apply mathematical concepts, develop problem-solving skills, and cultivate positive attitudes towards Mathematics, preparing them for lifelong success.

#### Key Programmes

##### Making Math Fun through Technology 
Technology enhances engagement in Math classrooms by incorporating interactive tools. Students solve word problems in digital Escape Rooms, practicing problem-solving without realizing it. Platforms like Class point, Kahoot, Blooket, and Quizziz make learning assessments fun and engaging. Technology also helps make students’ thinking visible, allowing teachers to identify and address misconceptions, ensuring a deeper understanding of Math concepts in real-time.

##### Mathematics Trails in School 
Mathematics Trails provide Primary 2 & Primary 4 students with the opportunity to apply their mathematical skills to real-life problems around the school. Aligned with the curriculum, students work in teams to complete various tasks, enhancing their problem-solving abilities and teamwork. These hands-on activities foster an appreciation and enjoyment of mathematics through everyday situations.

##### Math Shopping Day 
Math Shopping Day was a meaningful and enjoyable experience for our students! Primary 1 and 2 students took on the role of shoppers at our very own YTPS Mart, while the Primary 6 students acted as retail assistants and cashiers, guiding their juniors along the way. The young shoppers learned to make thoughtful spending choices, developing their financial literacy in a fun and authentic setting. It was a heartwarming day of learning, interaction, and joy—and the students proudly brought their purchases home!

##### E2K 
The E2K Mathematics Programme is an enrichment initiative developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE) for upper primary pupils who show strong interest and ability in Mathematics. The programme aims to deepen mathematical thinking through a constructivist approach, encouraging pupils to build connections between their existing knowledge and new concepts. Through exploration, reasoning, and problem-solving, students develop higher-order thinking skills in a stimulating and engaging learning environment.

##### Recess Activities – World Math Day & PI Day 
As part of our Math recess activities, students celebrated World Math Day in April with the theme “Investigative Math,” engaging in hands-on tasks that involved applying addition and subtraction in real-life contexts to strengthen problem-solving skills. For Pi Day on 14 March, students explored math creatively - Primary 6 students solved equations to reveal hidden images using Excel, while Primary 3 students composed Pi Poems, with each line’s word count reflecting the digits of pi (3.14…). Both activities combined logic, creativity, and fun, helping students develop a deeper appreciation for mathematics in an interactive and enjoyable way.

##### Joyful Learning in Math - P1 Mental Math Relay 
Our Primary 1 students had a fantastic time participating in a Mental Math Relay. In this exciting interclass challenge, they took turns working on math questions alongside their classmates, encouraging quick thinking and active application of their mathematical skills. This engaging activity not only strengthened their math abilities but also fostered a spirit of cooperation and perseverance among the students. They thoroughly enjoyed the experience, making learning math both meaningful and fun!
