### Mathematics

#### Department Overview
The school believes that a strong grounding in Mathematics trains the mind and develops the capacity to think logically, critically, abstractly and creatively. These are important 21st century competencies that underpin much of everyday life, support learning in many fields of study and give students an advantage in a wide range of economic activities, innovative work and entrepreneurial endeavours.<br><br>
This is why ensuring that all students achieve a competent level of mathematics mastery that will serve them well in life, and support those with the interest and ability to pursue it at the highest possible level is the overarching aim that drives the efforts of the department. Teaching and learning is organised in a way that helps students acquire and apply mathematical concepts and skills; develop cognitive and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; and nurturing positive attitudes towards mathematics.

#### Key Programmes

##### Making Math Fun through Technology
Technology is used to enhance student engagement in Math classrooms. For example, word problems are embedded in digital Escape Rooms for students to solve and “breakout”, without them realizing that they are actually practising their math problem solving skills. Kahoot and Quizziz are also used to assess students learning in a fun and engaging manner. Technology is also used to make students thinking visible so that teachers can address their misconceptions during lessons.

##### Mathematics Trails in School
Mathematics Trails provide opportunities for students to apply mathematical skills to solve real-life problems. Students develop an appreciation and enjoyment of Mathematics in everyday situations by completing different tasks around the school. These trails which are aligned to the curriculum and are specially designed for our Primary 2 to Primary 4 students. The students work in teams and collaborate to solve the various tasks.

##### Math Shopping Day
The Math Shopping Day allows students to apply the concepts they have learnt in Math lessons in an authentic situation. The Primary 1 and Primary 2 students plan and buy shopping items within a given budget. Besides creating an opportunity for students to apply the concept of money in a real-life situation, the activity also helps to develop their financial literacy skills.


##### E2K
E2K Mathematics Programme is an enrichment programme developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE) for upper primary pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. This programme aims to develop mathematical thinking using constructivist concepts, in which the pupils create links between prior knowledge and new knowledge.

#####  Learning Support for Mathematics
The LSM helps to build up pupils' confidence through encouragement and success experiences. Our Primary 1 to 3 LSM pupils learn through hands-on experiences and have more opportunities to play Math games to reinforce understanding during lessons.
